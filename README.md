# AI-powered-Parenting-Assistant

## Overview: 
The Parenting AI Assistant is designed to provide real-time, AI-powered guidance to parents who need advice on handling various parenting situations. The assistant processes both text and audio inputs, allowing parents to either describe their parenting concerns through text or speak them out via voice recordings. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and predefined agents, the assistant delivers respectful, insightful, and practical parenting advice.

This project aims to guide parents through their challenges by offering:
- Practical parenting strategies based on input data.
- Emotional analysis of the parent's tone or wording.
- Parenting tips from a knowledge base.
