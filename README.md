# AI-powered-Parenting-Assistant

## Overview: 
The Parenting AI Assistant is designed to provide real-time, AI-powered guidance to parents who need advice on handling various parenting situations. The assistant processes both text and audio inputs, allowing parents to either describe their parenting concerns through text or speak them out via voice recordings. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and predefined agents, the assistant delivers respectful, insightful, and practical parenting advice.
- This is a parenting AI assistant. 
- I created it using Cohere API.
- It has dual input functions: Text input and voice input.
- I have used the HuggingFace transformer pipeline in which I used the OpenAI Whisper model to convert voice input to text. 
- I used the Gradio web interface to make it more friendly users.
- I have included all the dependencies required for this project.
